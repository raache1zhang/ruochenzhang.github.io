  <p>
    I am currently a <strong>M.Eng student</strong> in Fluid Mechanics at Xian Jiaotong University
    advised by Prof. Simin Wang.
    I hold a Bachelor in Mechanical Engineering and Finance from Xian Jiaotong University.
  </p>


  <p>
  
My research focuses on multiphase fluid dynamics, turbulence, and microbubble transport, with an emphasis on combining experimental diagnostics and numerical simulations to understand interfacial transport phenomena. 
During my graduate studies, I have investigated bubble fragmentation in swirling flows, wet particle collisions in multiphase systems, and the thermal-hydraulic performance of industrial energy systems. 
  <i class="fa-solid fa-rectangle-ad" style="color: #d60000;"></i> 
    <span style="color: #d60000;">I am looking for Ph.D. position in 2026 Fall, where I aim to deepen my research in fluid dynamics while contributing to an inclusive and collaborative academic environment.</span>
